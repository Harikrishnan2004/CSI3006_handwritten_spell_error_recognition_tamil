# **Handwritten Spelling Error Recognition and Correction in Tamil Language: A Context-Aware Approach**

---

## 📜 **Abstract**

Correcting spelling errors in **handwritten Tamil text** presents considerable challenges due to its intricate character set. **Handwriting styles vary significantly**, and words with similar sounds but different spellings further complicate accurate recognition.

This project integrates **neural networks** and **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques to develop a **context-aware spelling correction system** for handwritten Tamil text. The solution aims to:

✅ **Detect and correct spelling errors.**  
✅ **Understand the contextual significance of words.**  
✅ **Address challenges like character similarity and ambiguous handwriting.**  

By leveraging **deep learning and NLP**, this model ensures **improved accuracy** in handwritten Tamil text recognition and correction.

**Keywords:** Handwritten text, Neural networks, Natural language processing, Tamil script, Spelling correction.

## 📖 **Introduction**

Tamil, one of the **oldest Dravidian languages**, has a complex script with **247 characters**, including:

- **12 vowels** (*உயிர் எழுத்து*)  
- **18 consonants** (*மெய் எழுத்து*)  
- **1 special letter** (*ஆயுத எழுத்து*)  

Due to these complexities, even **minor variations** in letters can lead to incorrect words, making spelling errors common. This is further exacerbated by:

🔹 **Variability in handwriting styles.**  
🔹 **Decreasing proficiency in written Tamil, even among fluent speakers.**  
🔹 **The lack of automated tools for effective Tamil spelling correction.**  

This project **digitizes handwritten Tamil text** using **Unicode** and applies **machine learning models** to detect and correct errors **based on context**. The goal is to provide a **self-learning tool** for students and language enthusiasts, enabling them to **write Tamil accurately** without external assistance.
